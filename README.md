This repository contains files from an ongoing project I'm using to learn the basics of
FastAPI, Docker, MongoDB, and Golang.

Currently, it includes a simple to-do list API where the user can manage items using the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

A first version was already developed as a proof of concept, without data persistence in MongoDB.

The next step is to persist data using a MongoDB instance running in a Docker container on the local machine.
